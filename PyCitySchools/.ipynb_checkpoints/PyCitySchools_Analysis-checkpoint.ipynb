    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "### Pandas Challenge\n",
    "### Jason Hanlin - Chief Data Scientist, PyCity Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis\n",
    "This challenge took data from two sets of data.  The first included math and reading grades for all high school student data for the entire school district, both district schools and charter schools.  The second set included size and budget for each school.  The goal of this analysis is to determine if there are any correlations between the school characteristics and the math and reading scores.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the close to 40,000 students in the district, 75% are passing math and 86% are passing reading.  But only 65% are passing both.  On average, math scores are about 3 points lower than reading scores.  The total budget for the 15 schools is \\\\$24.6M. Holden HS, a charter school, has the lowest budget at $248k and Bailey HS, a district school, has the highest budget at \\\\$3.124M.  However, Bailey is a much bigger school than Holden and per capita budgets will be explored later.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The top eight perfroming schools are all charter schools while the bottom seven performing schools are all district schools.  The lowest performing school, Rodriguez HS has a passing rate of 53\\%, while the top performaing school, Carbrerra HS has a passing rate of 92\\%.  While their reading passing rates are relatively close (between 80-84\\%), their math scores are the biggest difference with passing scores of 66\\% versus 94\\%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Not much has changed over the last four years since both the math and reading scores are consistently within 1-2 percentage points over the four classes within each school.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Per capita budgets range from \\\\$578-\\\\$655 showing that funding is fairly evenly distributed among schools.  However, a closer look shows that schools with the lowest amount of funding have the highest test scores and passing rates, with scores getting worse as school budgets increase.  Passing rates do not appear to be a function of spending and the opposite appears true.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Scores stay consistent with small (less than 1000 students) and medium (1000 to 2000 students), however they tend to fall off for large schools (2000 to 5000 students).  Particularly with overall passing rates that drop from 90% to 58% from small/medium to large schools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The results from this challenge show that charter schools significantly outperform district schools by about 27, 16, 37 percentage points for math, reading, and overall passing rates, respectively. Charter school status appears to be the biggest indicator of high performing schools with small to medium schools also performing better, but to a lesser degree. \n",
